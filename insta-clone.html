        <!-- Features -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User authentication (signup, login).</li>
                <li>Upload and display photos in a user feed.</li>
                <li>Follow/unfollow users and interact with posts (like, comment).</li>
                <!-- <li>Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.</li> -->
                <li>Infinite scrolling with pagination using <code>postid_lte</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>page</code> query parameters for optimized data loading.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Architecture/Design -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Architecture/Design</h2>
            <p>The project combines Flask for server-side operations with Jinja templating to render the Explore, User, and Account pages, while React handles dynamic content on the Feed and single post pages. Communication between the front-end and back-end is facilitated through a REST API, which supports pagination for the user feed.</p>
            <p>Data is stored in SQLite, and user sessions are managed using Flaskâ€™s session management for authentication. The REST API allows clients to pass query parameters like <code>postid_lte</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>page</code> to fetch posts and enable continuous scrolling, loading posts dynamically as needed.</p>
        </div>        

        <!-- Pagination Mechanism -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Pagination</h2>
            <p>To support infinite scrolling, the pagination system allows the client to request posts in chunks. The query parameters include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>postid_lte=N:</strong> Fetch posts with an ID less than or equal to N.</li>
                <li><strong>size=N:</strong> Specify the number of posts to return per request.</li>
                <li><strong>page=N:</strong> Request a specific page of results (useful for non-infinite scrolling scenarios).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Challenges & Solutions -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>One challenge was ensuring user authentication was secure and efficient. Flask's session-based authentication simplified this process, ensuring only logged-in users could interact with protected routes.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was optimizing the feed for large datasets. Pagination was implemented using a React library, but we encountered issues like duplicate posts in the first 10 pages and inconsistent post loading between requests. These issues occurred due to improper handling of the <code>postid_lte</code> parameter. To resolve this, we refined how query parameters were managed to ensure correct data retrieval across multiple requests.</p>
            <p>This experience reinforced the importance of scalable data handling in large applications. While a simpler JavaScript scrolling window could have been used, it would have required loading all data at once, making it inefficient for handling large-scale datasets.</p>
        </div>
        
         <!-- Lessons Learned -->
         <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>This project deepened my understanding of efficient data handling, particularly pagination and its role in scalability. I strengthened my skills in integrating RESTful APIs, session-based authentication with Flask, and managing dynamic front-end data with React. Debugging pagination issues also gave me valuable insight into how large-scale applications optimize content delivery for seamless user experiences.</p>

        <!-- Future Improvements -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Future Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Transition to Full Client-Side Dynamic Pages:</strong></p>
                    <p>Currently, the app uses React for the Feed and individual posts, while Flask handles the Explore, User, and Account pages. Moving forward, I plan to refactor the entire app to be fully client-side by transitioning all pages to React. This shift will enable a seamless, single-page experience, where content is dynamically loaded on the client-side, improving performance and providing a smoother user experience.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Stories Feature:</strong></p>
                    <p>Implement time-based content expiration by automatically deleting or hiding posts after 24 hours. Explore database strategies for expiring content. Improve real-time UI updates to dynamically reflect disappearing stories without requiring a page refresh.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Videos on the FYP:</strong></p>
                    <p>Expand the For You Page (FYP) to include video posts, enabling users to upload and view videos alongside images, creating a richer feed experience.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project was an excellent learning experience that allowed me to develop and refine my full-stack skills. I gained valuable insights into Flask, session management, and creating user-centric web applications. Iâ€™m proud of the progress made, especially in integrating front-end React with back-end Flask.</p>
            <p>However, I recognize that there are still areas for improvement. For instance, the current app still relies on a hybrid architecture, combining client-side React with server-side Flask for certain pages. Moving forward, I plan to refactor the entire app to be fully client-side, which will help optimize performance and provide a smoother experience for users. Additionally, further improvements can be made to the feedâ€™s scalability, especially when handling large datasets.</p>
            <p>Despite these areas of improvement, Iâ€™m excited about the progress Iâ€™ve made and the potential for future updates. This project has given me a solid foundation, and I look forward to building on it.</p>
