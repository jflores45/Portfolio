        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a basic search engine that allows users to search for documents. It indexes content from a set of documents and provides relevant search results based on user queries. The project demonstrates the core functionalities of search engines, including indexing, querying, and ranking.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Motivation/Goal -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Motivation/Goal</h2>
            <p>The project was inspired by the need to understand how search engines work under the hood. The goal was to implement a simple search engine that processes user queries and retrieves relevant results effectively, enhancing my skills in data structures and algorithms.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Features -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Document indexing for efficient search.</li>
                <li>Support for basic query functionalities.</li>
                <li>Ranking results based on relevance.</li>
                <li>User-friendly interface for easy navigation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Technical Stack -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Stack</h2>
            <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, JavaScript</p>
            <p><strong>Frameworks/Libraries:</strong> Flask (Backend), jQuery (Frontend)</p>
            <p><strong>Database:</strong> SQLite</p>
            <p><strong>APIs/Libraries:</strong> BeautifulSoup (for web scraping), NLTK (for natural language processing)</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Architecture/Design -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Architecture/Design</h2>
            <p>The project utilizes a client-server architecture where the front-end, built with Flask, communicates with the backend to fetch search results. It processes queries and retrieves relevant documents from the SQLite database based on user input.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Challenges & Solutions -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>A major challenge was ensuring that the search results were relevant to the user's query. I implemented tokenization and stemming using NLTK to improve the accuracy of the search results, which significantly enhanced user satisfaction.</p>
        </div>
